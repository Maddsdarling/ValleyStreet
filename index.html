        <h2>What is Urban Renewal?</h2>
            <div class="renewal">
            <p>Urban renewal is the action of removing “blighted” sections of cities by the local governments to increase economic growth. On paper, urban renewal sounds like it would be incredibly healing to communities and bring opportunities to those living in the area. Unfortunately this is not the case across the United States. Instead urban renewal uprooted many black communities and closed BIPOC owned businesses.<br><br>
The East End/Valley Street Neighborhood didn't end up seeing this economic growth and instead this blooming neighborhood and business district became government buildings and parking lots. After years of the community being redlined and unable to obtain funding to maintain this historic neighborhood as well as the city failing to maintain infrastructure in the area, the City of Asheville displaced many of its residents, most of which never returned.

                <p>The section of the East End/Valley Street Neighborhood we are highlighting was home to some of the oldest African American Churches. Sycamore Temple Church of God in Christ was located on Sycamore Hill prior to the 1970s when the church grew too large and moved downtown. The other two churches, Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church and St. Matthias Episcopal Church, were both built by a local, well respected Black Mason named James Vester Miller. Both Mount Zion and St. Matthias are pillars in the community.  </p>

                <p>Eagle street and Valley street were home to a wide variety of businesses including a grocery store, barber, laundry mat, jewelry store, and theatre. The theatre was large, seating 350 people. This area was home to multiple law offices and a pharmacy as well. The area was bustling with life and African Americans moved from across the region to this area. Celebrities would travel to perform here as well.  </p>

        <h2>The Community</h2>
        <div id="sect3">
            <div class="text1">
                <p>The East End was home to multiple schools, the YMI, and many residences. The YMI was a center for the Black community serving schools, churches, and a variety of organizations as a place to gather and organize. Stephens-Lee Highschool was one of the schools in the area and was successful from the moment it opened till the day it closed in 1965. The sports teams and bands were award winning and some of the musicians who attended went on to play with James Brown and Marvin Gaye. </p>
